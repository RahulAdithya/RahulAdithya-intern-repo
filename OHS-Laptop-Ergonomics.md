# Occupational Health & Safety (OHS): Laptop Ergonomics
**Author:** Rahul Adithya

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### 1. Risks of Direct Laptop Use
Using a laptop on a flat desk without external peripherals often leads to "Laptop Hunch." Key risks include:
* **Cervical Strain (Text Neck):** Looking down for long periods puts immense pressure on the neck and spine.
* **Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI):** The cramped layout of laptop keyboards and trackpads can cause wrist and finger discomfort.
* **Eye Strain:** Fixed focal distances and screen glare can lead to headaches and blurred vision.

### 2. Ergonomic Equipment Solutions
* **Laptop Stand:** Raises the screen to eye level to prevent neck slouching.
* **External Keyboard & Mouse:** Allows your elbows to remain at a 90-degree angle while your shoulders stay relaxed.
* **Ergonomic Chair:** Provides lumbar support to maintain the natural curve of the spine.



### 3. Ideal Setup Adjustments
* **Monitor Height:** The top third of the screen should be at eye level.
* **Chair Position:** Feet should be flat on the floor with knees at a 90-degree angle.
* **Desk Height:** Your forearms should be parallel to the floor when typing.

### 4. Healthy Daily Habits
* **20-20-20 Rule:** Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds to reduce eye strain.
* **Movement Breaks:** Standing up and stretching every hour to improve circulation.
* **Posture Checks:** Frequently checking if shoulders are hunched toward the ears.

## 📝 Reflection

### Equipment Changes
I plan to improve my workspace by utilizing a **laptop stand** and a separate **Bluetooth keyboard**. This will allow me to elevate the display to eye level while keeping my wrists in a neutral, supported position on the desk surface.

### Behavioural Changes
The biggest change I can implement is **sitting upright** with my back against the chair's lumbar support. I often find myself leaning forward toward the screen when working sometimes, so I will make a conscious effort to sit back and relax my shoulders.

### Reminders for Breaks
I will use **Focus Bear** to schedule mandatory 5-minute movement breaks every hour. Since Focus Bear can "take over" the screen, it is the perfect tool to force me to step away from the desk and stretch, ensuring that physical health remains a priority alongside productivity.

## 🛠️ Task Completion

### Workspace Adjustment
I have adjusted my setup by placing my laptop on a stable stack of books (as a temporary stand), effectively raising the webcam and screen to my eye level.

### Equipment Identification
I have identified that an **external mouse** is a critical piece of equipment I need to reduce the strain on my wrist caused by extended use of the Mac trackpad.

### Movement Reminders
I tested the Focus Bear movement reminders for a full workday.
* **Observation:** I felt significantly less "brain fog" and lower back stiffness at the end of the 4-hour block compared to sessions where I didn't take structured breaks.
* **Documented Habit:** I have officially added a "Shoulder Roll & Stretch" habit to my Focus Bear routine that triggers every 60 minutes of deep work.
