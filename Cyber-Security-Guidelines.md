# Cyber Security Guidelines & Reflection
**Author:** Rahul Adithya

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### 1. Common Cyber Security Threats in Remote Work
* **Phishing:** Deceptive emails designed to steal credentials or install malware.
* **Insecure Wi-Fi:** Working from public networks without a VPN can lead to data interception.
* **Weak Authentication:** Using simple or reused passwords across different work platforms.
* **Social Engineering:** Manipulating individuals into divesting confidential information.

### 2. Best Practices for Device & Account Security
* **Keep Software Updated:** Regularly patch your OS and applications to fix vulnerabilities.
* **Disk Encryption:** Ensure Mac FileVault is active to protect data if the device is lost.
* **Minimalist Access:** Only install necessary software and use standard (non-admin) accounts for daily tasks.

### 3. Importance of Locking Your Computer
Locking your computer prevents unauthorized physical access to sensitive company data, GitHub repositories, and internal communications while you are away from your desk. It is a critical habit for maintaining data integrity in shared or remote spaces.

### 4. Handling Phishing & Suspicious Links
* **Verify the Sender:** Carefully inspect the sender's email address for slight misspellings.
* **Hover Before Clicking:** Hover over links to see the actual destination URL.
* **Report:** If a link looks suspicious, do not click it; report it to the security team or your supervisor immediately.

### 5. Strong Passwords & Password Managers
* **Strong Passwords:** Should be long (12+ characters), unique for every account, and include a mix of symbols, numbers, and letters.
* **Password Managers:** These tools store encrypted credentials, allowing you to use high-complexity passwords without needing to memorize them, which prevents credential stuffing attacks.

### 6. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
2FA provides a vital second layer of security. Even if a password is compromised, an attacker cannot gain access without the second factor (like a code from an authenticator app). It should be enabled on all work accounts, especially GitHub and Gmail, immediately.

## 📝 Reflection

### Current Measures & Improvements
I currently follow basic hygiene like avoiding suspicious links, but I can improve by ensuring 100% of my work-related accounts use unique, randomly generated passwords stored in a manager.

### Making Security a Habit
I will integrate security into my **Focus Bear routines**. By adding a "Security Audit" habit at the end of my work sessions, checking for open sensitive tabs and pending system updates will become automatic rather than an afterthought.

### Steps for Account Security
I will audit my GitHub and Google accounts to ensure 2FA is active using an authenticator app. I will also migrate any remaining "memorized" passwords into a secure password manager.

### Response to Suspected Breach
If I suspect a breach, I will:
1. Immediately change my primary passwords from a secure, clean device.
2. Revoke all active sessions in account settings.
3. Notify my supervisor at Focus Bear immediately to prevent further organizational risk.

## 🛠️ Task Checklist
* [x] **Strong Passwords & 2FA:** Enabled on GitHub and work Gmail.
* [x] **Password Manager:** Evaluated current storage and set up a secure manager for work credentials.
* [x] **Auto-Lock:** MacBook set to lock automatically after 2 minutes of inactivity.
* [x] **New Habit:** I will perform a "Tab Audit" at the end of every Focus Session to ensure no sensitive credentials or company data are left open in my browser.
