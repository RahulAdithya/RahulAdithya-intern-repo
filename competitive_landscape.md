# Research Assignment: Competitive Landscape
**Author:** Rahul Adithya

## 1. What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?
Focus Bear distinguishes itself by acting as an active "digital prefrontal cortex" rather than a passive tracker.
* **Proactive Enforcement:** While apps like Freedom or Tiimo "ask" for focus through notifications, Focus Bear **enforces** it via full-screen takeovers for routines and breaks.
* **The Allow-List Philosophy:** Unlike legacy blockers that use "block-lists" (identifying specific distractions), Focus Bear blocks the entire internet *except* for the tools you specifically need for your task.
* **AI-Driven Intent Filtering:** It uses AI to analyze website content in real-time, allowing research-heavy sites while filtering out distracting clickbait on the same domain.
* **Integrated Health Habits:** It forces physical wellness into the workday by mandating breaks for stretching or exercise, which most "pure" blockers ignore.

## 2. If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?
As a student, I would choose Focus Bear for its ability to handle "time blindness" and executive dysfunction.
* **Consolidated Scaffolding:** It replaces the need for multiple separate apps (a blocker, a habit tracker, and a timer) by merging them into one unified system.
* **Morning Scaffolding:** The ability to "hijack" my devices upon waking ensures I complete my morning meditation or exercise before I can reach for social media.
* **Meeting-Safe Logic:** Features like "Meeting Detection" and "Late No More" ensure that hard blocking doesn't make me unprofessional or late for university calls.

## 3. What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?
* **Gamification:** Apps like **Forest** use a virtual reward system (growing a virtual tree) to create dopamine hits and loss aversion, which Focus Bear currently lacks.
* **Visual Aesthetic:** **Tiimo** offers a highly polished, icon-driven visual timeline that is much more "gentle" and aesthetic than Focus Bear's current functional interface.

## 4. Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?
Focus Bear could implement **State-Based Adaptive Rigidity**. 
By syncing with wearables (like an Apple Watch or Oura ring) to monitor energy levels and stress, the app could automatically become "Grizzlier" (stricter) when it detects I am struggling to focus, and "Cuddlier" (more flexible) when it detects I am in a state of burnout or high creative flow.
