# Company Reflection: Focus Bear
**Author: Rahul Adithya**

### 1. Why do you think Focus Bear was created?
I believe it was done due to the fact that will power is no longer sufficient. Majority of productivity tools are time tracking tools but Focus Bear was created to interfere. It can be easily described as something that is created specifically to be consumed by those who are easily overwhelmed with the amount of tabs and various notifications that one has to receive to complete one assignment.

### 2. What problem is Focus Bear solving?
It is resolving the issue of digital distraction, particularly in individuals with ADHD or who have difficulties with executive functioning. The most difficult thing at university is not necessarily the work, but the process of getting down to business and remaining on the page and not switching to YouTube and Discord. It addresses the problem of the rabbit hole of losing three hours to nothing.

### 3. Why do you think this mission is important?
It is significant as the amount of attention is minimal. Distraction is not only distracting to students but also detrimental to their performance in the level of failed courses, anxiety, and burnout, particularly among neurodivergent students. The issue of assisting people to organize their time and attention is more a matter of mental health than a matter of productivity.

### 4. How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?
I appreciate tools that are useful and address real human issues as someone who studies technology and operates in complex systems (as it applies to blockchain or network security). I appreciate the concept of guarding our attention by use of software as opposed to merely vying of our attention as in the case of social media apps.

### 5. Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?
Yes, definitely. I am a student in Melbourne and tend to find it difficult to remain focused when working remotely or studying late at home. Distractions caused by phone messages are very easy to fall into and on numerous occasions, I would have scheduled myself hours of studying only to achieve very little of the actual work. The struggle of getting started on something is also something that I can identify with, that start up cost can be a serious impediment. It is something I can really imagine assisting me, and others I know, to be more consistent and on track by seeing how Focus Bear utilizes routines to minimize that friction.
